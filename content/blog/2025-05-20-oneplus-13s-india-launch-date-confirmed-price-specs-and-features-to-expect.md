The OnePlus 13s launch teasers have been coming in swift in the last few days and we finally have the official date for the new OnePlus 13 series phone in the Indian market. OnePlus 13s will become the third device in the OnePlus 13 series which already has the 13R in the lineup.

The brand has confirmed this will be a compact flagship phone with the latest Snapdragon 8 series chipset and some more interesting features on board. 

**OnePlus 13s India Launch Date And More Details Revealed** 

The [OnePlus 13s India launch](https://www.news18.com/tech/oneplus-13s-india-launch-confirmed-new-flagship-phone-coming-9316669.html) has been officially confirmed for June 5, 2025 which is just a few weeks away from now. The 13s launch event will happen at 12PM IST on the said date. 

**OnePlus 13s India Price And Features Expected** 

The OnePlus 13s is likely to feature a 6.32-inch display which makes it the ideal compact device with powerful credentials. The OnePlus 13s is going to launch in black, pink and even green as the colour options in India. The flat design and the square-ish camera module shown in the teasers hint at a dual sensor system like the 13T which should have a telephoto lens. 

It will be intriguing to see if the OnePlus 13s gets any sort of IP rating and packs a 6,000mAh+ sized battery with support for fast charging. It will surely launch with the Android 15-based OxygenOS version and probably some AI features baked into the device like the other OnePlus 13 series models. 

We also know that the popular alert slider button is going away with the OnePlus 13s as the company moves to a Plus Key which functions like Apple’s Action button on iPhones. 

The leaks suggest the [OnePlus 13s launch price in India](https://www.news18.com/tech/oneplus-13s-launch-price-in-india-leaked-heres-what-it-may-cost-you-9338848.html) could be around Rs 50,000, while the same model could cost $649 in the US and AED 2,100 for people buying in Dubai.

Now we wait for the OnePlus 13s details to be officially revealed along with its expected price in the market which will show us how the new device will compete with other brands.
